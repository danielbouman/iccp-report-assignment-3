The eigenstates of the Hamiltonian have the property that they are, up to an unphysical global phase factor, invariant under time-translations. To check the stability and accuracy of the simulation, eigenstates of the Hamiltonian for the infinite square well are simulated. The deviation of the wavefunction with its initial state is then a measure for the accuracy and stability of the simulation. It might seem intuitive to define the deviation as the distance function that is naturally induced by the inner product on the Hilbert space. However, the projective nature of the Hilbert space in quantum mechanics should be taken into account, so that a more useful approach for the deviation $D$ would be to define it as

\[
D(t) = \int\mathrm{d}x\left(|\Psi(x,t)|^2-|\Psi(x,0)|^2\right)^2,
\]

where the integral is over all space.
